## Project Overview

DTH providers face challenges in managing and analyzing fragmented data from subscriptions, unsubscriptions, content, and customer engagement. This project delivers a centralized data warehouse that unifies these sources, enabling:

- Multidimensional analytics
- Customer retention strategies
- Personalized content recommendations
- Operational and financial reporting


## Features

- **All-in-One SQL Scripts:** All table creation and analytics queries are in `DW_Tables.sql` and `Queries.sql`, compatible with SSMS.
- **Sample Data Included:** Each table has a corresponding CSV file for easy import and testing.
- **Aggregated Tables:** Some tables are filled using ETL logic within the SQL scripts, based on data from other tables.
- **No Complex Folder Structure:** All files are in the root directory for simplicityâ€”no separate ETL, queries, or schema folders.
- **Visual Documentation:** Diagrams and schema images are provided in the `DWdiagrams` folder.



## Why This Project?

- **Optimize Customer Retention:** Identify churn drivers and implement targeted retention strategies.
- **Enhance Personalization:** Analyze viewing patterns to recommend relevant content and offers.
- **Improve Operational Efficiency:** Unified reporting for marketing, finance, and service teams.
- **Drive Revenue Growth:** Enable cross-sell, upsell, and dynamic pricing based on real usage data.


## Architecture

- **Data Sources:** CSV files for each dimension and fact table.
- **SQL Scripts:** All schema and analytics logic in `DW_Tables.sql` and `Queries.sql`.
- **Aggregated Tables:** Populated using SQL ETL logic after base tables are loaded.
- **Visualization:** Diagrams and schema images in `DWdiagrams`.

- **Feedback Sentiment:** Channel and plan-level sentiment analysis
- **Ad Effectiveness:** Engagement lift by ad type
- **Subscription Trends:** Monthly roll-ups and retention cohorts


## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**
   - Download or clone the repo to your local machine.

2. **Database Setup in SSMS**
   - Open `DW_Tables.sql` in SQL Server Management Studio.
   - Execute the script to create all tables and relationships.

3. **Import Sample Data**
   - For each table, use the SSMS Import Wizard or `BULK INSERT` to load the corresponding CSV file (e.g., `customer_dimension.csv` for the `Customer_dimension` table).

4. **Populate Aggregated Tables**
   - Some tables (e.g., `Monthly_aggregate_fact`, `Series_monthly_aggregate_fact`) are filled using SQL ETL logic included in `DW_Tables.sql`. Run the relevant insert statements after loading base data.

5. **Run Analytics Queries**
   - Open `Queries.sql` in SSMS.
   - Execute any analytics or reporting queries as needed.

6. **Visualize Schema and Analytics**
   - Refer to images in the `DWdiagrams` folder for schema diagrams and information package visuals.


## Usage

- **Run Analytics Queries:** Use `Queries.sql` to generate reports and insights.
- **Build Dashboards:** Connect BI tools (e.g., Power BI, Tableau) to your SQL Server database for visualization.
- **Customize:** Extend the data model or queries as per your requirements.
